          <p>This Agreement shall be exclusively governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to the
            choice or conflicts of law provisions thereof, and any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising
            out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
            the federal or state courts located in the city of Chicago, Illinois. You agree to resolve any dispute or
            claim that you may have against DRYV and to submit to personal jurisdiction in the exclusive jurisdiction of
            federal or state courts located in Chicago, Illinois. This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between
            the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether
            written or oral, between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein. If any provision of this
            Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision
            shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable
            provision, with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect. No joint venture, partnership,
            employment, or agency relationship exists between the parties as a result of this Agreement or use of the
            Services. The failure of DRYV to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a
            waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by DRYV in writing. The section headings
            in the Agreement are included for convenience only and shall take no part in the interpretation, or
            construing of the Agreement. "Including", whether capitalized or not, means without limitation. This
            Agreement may not be assigned by you without the prior written approval of DRYV and any assignment without
            such prior written consent shall be void.</p>
          <p><b>21. Changes in Ownership</b></p>
          <p>We may transfer ownerships rights and title in the Services, to any affiliated or unaffiliated third party
            (whether by way of merger, sale of shares, sale of assets, license or otherwise), provided that your rights
            according to this Agreement are not infringed by the transfer of ownership. In that case, all of your
            details and information pertaining to you will be passed on to the person or entity receiving the rights in
            the Services and you hereby give your prior consent thereto.</p>
          <p><b>22. Survival</b></p>
