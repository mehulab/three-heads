          <h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</h5>
          <p>We use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from our customers in a manner that does

          <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many other commercial sites, our website utilizes standard technologies
            called "cookies" to collect information about how our website is used. A cookie is a small data text file,
            that a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be
            retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies are designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a
            previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was
            browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. Cookies can
            securely store a customer's password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been
            visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." For instance, cookies
            allow us to prepopulate (or fill in) an email field with your email address if you revisit one of our
            website and place an order. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer
            virus, or capture your email address.</p>
          <p>We send a cookie to your hard drive when you make an order to record the product name, category of product
            that you ordered, the amount paid, the order number and any referral codes. No Personally Identifiable
            Information is recorded. When you click through to our website from a promotional email, our third-party
            advertising service partner may send a cookie to your hard drive recording your IP address and other related
            information.</p>

          <p><strong>Our Contractors</strong><br>We contract with other companies (such as application developers and
            Dry Cleaners) to provide certain services to DRYV or to you to fulfill service orders, and to improve the
            Software and Services. In some instances, these contractors may have access to Personally Identifiable
            Information but they are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information and to
            use it only for purposes of carrying out the business of DRYV.</p>

            from sharing this information with anyone other than DRYV.</p>

          <p>Notwithstanding the above policies, we may disclose your personal information to appropriate third parties
            if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is necessary:<br>To comply with legal
            process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order;<br>To protect the company's rights and
            property;<br>To investigate reports of fraud or of users sending material using a false e-mail address or
            users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages;<br>To protect against misuse or unauthorized use
            of our website; or<br>During emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at risk.</p>
          <h5>Your Choices</h5>
          <p>We offer choices about the types of information you receive from us. If you prefer not to receive Services
            information or other communications from DRYV or if you prefer to receive them less frequently, please
            contact us at <a href=../contact/index.html>support@dryv.com </a>. </p> <p>Please be sure to provide us your

              correct the situation.</p>
          <h5>Email Use</h5>
          <p>When you provide us your email address, we may send you emails necessary to process your order or respond
            to a request. For example, after you place an order you will receive an email receipt. It is our intent to
            send you promotional email only if you have agreed to receive it. Instructions on how to unsubscribe are
            included in each promotional e-mail or newsletter. Your email address will be used only to respond to your
            request or to process your order, and will not be shared with any third parties. Instructions for
            unsubscribing are included in every email containing promotional material.</p>
          <h5>Links to Other website</h5>
          <p>Occasionally we provide links on our website to other sites we think you will enjoy. These sites operate
            independently of DRYV and have established their own privacy and security policies. DRYV does not have any
            control over the privacy practices of these sites. For the best online experience, we strongly encourage you
            to review these policies at any site you visit.</p>
          <h5>Security</h5>
          <p>It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected
            from you. We employ reasonable security measures to protect the security of the information you submit to
            us. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to
            carry out their responsibilities. When you download the Software, use the Services, or request information,
            your transactional information is transmitted in a safe, encrypted format. We maintain the data you provide,
            along with a record of your purchases, in a secure database.</p>
          <p>We also encourage our partners and service providers to adopt and follow stringent consumer privacy
            policies.</p>
          <h5>Privacy of Children</h5>
          <p>It is our policy not to collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person under 13 because
            children are not permitted to use this Software or the Services, and we request that children under the age
            of 13 not submit any Personally Identifiable Information to us through the website. If we learn that we have
            inadvertently gathered Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13, we will promptly remove
            such information from our records.</p>
          <h5>Policy Changes</h5>
          <p>DRYV may at any time modify this Privacy Policy in our discretion without notice. Your use of this Software
            and Services will be conditioned upon the Privacy Policy that is [posted on our site at the time of your
            use]. Please be sure to review our Terms and Conditions (above) before proceeding to use our website.</p>
